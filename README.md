# PhotoCluster
An automated face matching and grouping application that returns all matching photos based on the faces present in the input image, with approximately 90% accuracy. Training involved image preprocessing, face detection, face embedding extraction, and clustering. Models such as MTCNN, FaceNet, PCA, CNN, and K-means were employed.
